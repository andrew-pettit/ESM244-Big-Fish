2012,7,2,10:6,"Goat Harbor, Catalina Island",33.41751,-118.396223,"7/2/2012. Goat Harbor. Viz:  Milky 20. Max depth: 69'. Temps: 65F. Six GSBs at Goat Harbor hung out with us. in the 45' range an entire hour. After awhile, I saw a dust cloud in the. sand and got a couple shots of a foraging bat ray before it flew away. Then. I found an angel shark! Wow! What a great first dive!! The only crummy part. was the viz but even that wasn't that bad. We could see all 6 GSBs at once. and they just kept circling around us. Some of them are more friendly than. others with the cameras. One very darkly colored GSB was hanging on the sand. and when I slowly approached it but was still at least 10&rsquo; away, it let out. 2 or 3 barks and bolted away. I didn't think the barks were directed at me. because the fish was looking the other direction but Michelle says that may. have been a warning to me to back off. It was cool behavior to observe!. Another cool moment was when Michelle was taking pix of the angel shark and. I saw a GSB just behind her, skimming the sand as if it was trying to. scratch an itch. It was a funny sight for such a big fish.",GSB329,Catalina Island- Goat Harbor,2019-10-26,true,false
